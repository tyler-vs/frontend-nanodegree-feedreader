# Feed Reader Testing

A Feed Reader for keeping on top of front end web development trends. And for learning about [JavaScript Testing](https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-testing--ud549) with the [Jasmine JS Testing Framework](https://jasmine.github.io/2.0/introduction.html).

Review the Feed Reader Testing [Project Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/3442558598/rubric).

## Installing

Some steps get started:

- Clone or download the repo
- Change directories into the repo from a CLI or unzip repo if downloaded and open folder 
- Open `index.html` in a web browser
- View the jasmine test results which usually display near the bottom of the page (should see a lot of green text)

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a web browser to start viewing new entries, by default an initial feed should appear for the Udacity Blog. 

__View Full Feed entry__

You can click the title of an entry to be redirected to that full entry's content on the feeds respective website/blog (i.e. a blog post or news article). 

__View Feed entries from a different feed__

To view entries from a different feed, simply locate and click the menu icon (appears as three white horizonal lines) near to the top left of the page. Upon clicking the menu button, a sidebar should slide from the left of the page containing a list of different feeds that can choosen. Clicking any of these feeds should result in replacing the current entries with the most recent entries of the feed that was selected.
